# Jewerly
WebSite to sell Jewerly 

-Hi, this project basically is a software to sell jewerly
-This project has been created to train my development habilities and try new features, API's and other things.
-The plan is create a login to users with informations which can be used to make promotions later, for example, the user has 10% discount if he bought 300$ in jewerly at year.
-This software will not be use to monetary utilities, just development!

The software is divided in 5 apps,they are:


# Base: 
 The base is used to store the main files about the apps, things like, bases html, base views and base urls

 # Users:
 The authentication system will sign up new users, login the users who already exists and make the seccurity of URLs. Permissions and things which will make the system flows correctly

# Orders: 
 Probably the most complex app of all. Will serve the employees, effect the buy of a product, see how much an order cost. Basically this is an admin side, which we can see more informations about a buy.  

# Products: 
 In the product app we can add new products to sell. Add discounts for costumers and view all the products already registred.

# Main view: 
 In the views app the user will search for some jewerly, see products in discount, order by price, etc. The costumer could to view a product's page, description, price and comments abouts that product. Could see your own profile and edit it.
